This file explains how to compress the Virtual Keyboard script with ESC
(EcmaScript Cruncher, http://www.saltstorm.net/depo/esc/) if you've
made changes to the original script and want to compress (and obfuscate) it.

The following procedure applies to full script (vkboard.js) and slim
variant of the script (vkboards.js). For other two variants, steps 3, 4 and 6
should be omitted.

1. In the archive with the ESC.wsf you'll find the 'bless.map.dynapi' file.
   Copy it to the same directory where ESC.wsf is; rename it to 'bless.map'
   and append the following items to the end of the file:

  Note 1: as you see in the above list, it contains all the bundled
  layouts. If you don't use any of them, you should omit it; if you
  use additional layouts, you must add them to the above list.

  Note 2: If you wish to use compressed script with the translator setup
 (see '3-edit-translator.html'), then you must additionally append
  this line:

     _refresh_layout

2. Cut legal (disclaimer) part, and save it to another file (e.g. 'legal.txt').

3. Compress 'vkboard.js' to 'vkboardc.js' with level of compression of 4:

     cscript ESC.wsf -l 4 -ow vkboardc.js vkboard.js

4. Restore the disclaimer (from 'legal.txt') at the start of the script.
   Don't forget to mention changes you've made and the tool you've used
   for compression.
