1. There are four keyboard variants available:

   1) "1-vkboard" - primary script. Full keyboard is simulated;

   2) "2-vkboard_slim" - the same, but has a special configuration
      of the language menu, useful if you're short of space;

   3) "3-numpad_full" - numeric pad part of the keyboard. Useful for
      online calculators;

   4) "4-numpad_atm" - stripped numpad: numbers and Enter key only.

2. For each variant, two versions of script are available:

   1) "vkboard.js"/"vkboards.js"/"vnumpad.js"/"vatmpad.js" is the original
      script; if you wish to change the script, or just want to learn how it
      works, this is the file for you to look at;

   2) "vkboardc.js"/"vkboardsc.js"/"vnumpadc.js"/"vatmpadc.js" (in the
      "compressed" folder) is the compressed version of script
     (30.5%/30.5%/39.8%/39.5% smaller than the original); this
      is the file you should use on the web.

3. "5-layout_pack" folder contains 24 additional layouts for full/slim variants
   of the keyboard. Please see "readme.txt" file within the "5-layout_pack"
   folder for more details.
